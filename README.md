### App 1: Stock Analysis Dashboard

The Stock Analysis Dashboard is a Streamlit application designed to provide users with the ability to chart the prices of individual stocks and compare the performance of two different stocks. The app fetches data via API calls, including stock prices, financial statements, and news articles related to the stocks.

Added another feature for portfolio tracking.

### App 2: Energy Forecasting

This app conducts energy forecasting based on past consumption data. It adapts Rob Mulla's energy forecasting project to work with any file containing energy data, provided the first column is the date and the second is the energy consumption value.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Developed a frontend using Streamlit, allowing users to input their own files into the data model. ðŸ’»
- Generated plots to display hourly and monthly power consumption trends. ðŸ“ˆ
- Implemented XGBoost for future predictions by training the model on historical data.



App 3: Global GHG Emissions Visualization Tool

This Streamlit app highlights my GIS plotting skills by visualizing global greenhouse gas emissions. Users can interact with a detailed world map that displays CO2 and other GHG emissions by country, equipped with a time slider to observe changes over the years. It provides in-depth details on emissions, population, and GDP for a comprehensive understanding of each country's environmental impact.

Technical Highlights:

    Utilizes advanced GIS plotting to represent complex geographical data visually.
    Interactive elements like a time slider enhance user engagement and data exploration.
    Provides a comparative analysis tool for countries, supporting environmental research and education.

App 4: Currency Conversion Product

This app simplifies financial transactions by enabling real-time currency conversion. Users can select from a list of global currencies and input amounts to see converted values based on current exchange rates, making it ideal for travelers and finance professionals.
