# Streamlit Apps Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of Streamlit apps developed as part of my portfolio. I have completed two apps so far and plan to add one new app each week.

### App 1: Stock Analysis Dashboard

The Stock Analysis Dashboard is a Streamlit application designed to provide users with the ability to chart the prices of individual stocks and compare the performance of two different stocks. The app fetches data via API calls, including stock prices, financial statements, and news articles related to the stocks.

### App 2: Energy Forecasting

This app conducts energy forecasting based on past consumption data. It adapts Rob Mulla's energy forecasting project to work with any file containing energy data, provided the first column is the date and the second is the energy consumption value.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Developed a frontend using Streamlit, allowing users to input their own files into the data model. ðŸ’»
- Generated plots to display hourly and monthly power consumption trends. ðŸ“ˆ
- Implemented XGBoost for future predictions by training the model on historical data.

## Future Plans

I am planning to add one new app each week, covering various domains and functionalities. Stay tuned for more updates!

This is an ongoing project, and I am excited to continue developing and enhancing this portfolio. Feedback and contributions are welcome!
