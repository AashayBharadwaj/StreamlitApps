# Stock Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains a collection of small Streamlit apps developed for my portfolio projects. 
I am developing these apps iteratively, adding new features and improvements over time.

## Project Overview

The Stock Analysis Dashboard is a Streamlit application designed to provide users with the ability to chart the prices of individual stocks and compare the performance of two different stocks. This project leverages various APIs to fetch data for financial statements and news related to the stocks.
