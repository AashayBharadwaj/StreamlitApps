A simple yet powerful web application built with Streamlit that allows users to track historical exchange rates for various currencies using the Yahoo Finance API via the `yfinance` library.

## Features

- **Data Visualization**: View a line chart that displays the historical exchange rates for the selected currency pair over the chosen time period.
